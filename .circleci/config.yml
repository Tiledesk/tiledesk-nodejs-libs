# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference
version: 2.1

# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/orb-intro/
orbs:
  # See the Node orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@5.2

jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  build-and-test:  
    # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:16.17.1
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
      - node/install-packages
      # If you are using yarn instead npm, remove the line above and uncomment the two lines below.
      # - node/install-packages:
      #     pkg-manager: yarn 
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            # when lock file changes, use increasingly general patterns to restore cache
            - node-v1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
            - node-v1-{{ .Branch }}-
            - node-v1-
      - save_cache:
          paths:
            - ~/usr/local/lib/node_modules  # location depends on npm version
          key: node-v1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: npm test

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  sample: 
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
